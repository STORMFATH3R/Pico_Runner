My entry in the Pico-8 1k jam. Where you have to make a game or software with a compressed size of 1 KB my entry is 992 B and is an endless runner engine you can use to make your dream game! 

Features

Platform spawner with pooling and randomization
Basic player control
Gravity
Basic Collision
Simple state machine

It is only 540/8192 Tokens in size leaving you plenty of room to build your game around the engine. I have included a commented version of the code; it's slightly bigger at a compressed size of 1541 B. The upside is the Token count being nearly the same at 543.

Please send me anything you use this to make, I would love to try your games!
